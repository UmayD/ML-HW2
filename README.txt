To run the program via terminal commands, navigate to the required folder and type "python main.py".
It also can be run with using Python IDLE Shell. Just open the fil with IDLE and run. 
Libraries should be already installed. (os, cv2, numpy, matplotlib, time, random, scipy.io, sklearn)

Once the program is run, all the questions will be run one-by-one.
If the user wants to run questions separately, go to the main part of "main.py".
All unwanted parts can be commented out to do so.

Datasets should be in a folder called "datasets".
